    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This is a great alternative to a cold pasta salad as farro doesn't get soggy and holds up to the dressing very well. Farro is an ancient Mediterranean grain, so I wanted to merge it with a Greek-style salad that's perfect for summertime. This is great served with grilled lamb or chicken. Add black olives or fresh herbs to your liking!</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups farro</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup seeded, diced tomato</li>
        <li>1 cup seeded, diced cucumber</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Rinse farro with water; drain. Place farro in a pot; pour in chicken broth to cover farro by at least one inch, adding water if needed. Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil and sea salt. </li>
        <li>Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until tender, about 35 minutes for whole grain farro or about 20 minutes for pearled farro.</li>
        <li>Drain farro, rinse with cold water, and set aside to cool completely, about 15 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Whisk 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, Greek seasoning, and garlic together in a large bowl. Stir in tomato, cucumber, red pepper, red onion, and feta cheese. Stir farro into tomato mixture until completely coated with dressing; season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate salad for about 2 hours before serving.</li>
